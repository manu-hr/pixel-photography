# Pixel Photography

## Context

Pixel photography is a well known fast growing photography website, covering every aspect of image-making, from DSLRs and photo editing. Now, the company is very keen on making the information available in the best possible way so that the information is **well presented and organized** on all web devices.​ 

As a Frontend Developer, you would have to create a **Responsive** Web Page to showcase all the pictures in a way that will inspire new photographers and help Pixel Photography to reach a wider audience.

## Problem Statement

Create a responsive web page using bootstrap classes that resembles the image below.

## Tasks

- The `index.html` file contains the code for web page that needs to be transformed into responsive web page.​​
- Bootstrap framework CSS classes should be used to style the page for responsiveness.​​
- The responsiveness has to be implemented based on Column Drop Layout pattern​​
- This pattern starts with multi-column layout and ends up with single column, dropping columns along the way as screen sizes get narrower.​​
